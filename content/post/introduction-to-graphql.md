# Introduction to GraphQL

This post embeds a recorded presentation I gave at the offices of [Pusher](https://pusher.com) where I currently work.

The talk is a short introduction on GraphQL. My goal here is to describe how GraphQL works, how it positions against similar approaches and to give an example of how one might use it to design an API for a blog engine. If you want more details about that process I previously wrote a blog post [GraphQL with Go and PostgreSQL](http://alexandrutopliceanu.ro/post/graphql-with-go-and-postgresql/) and an implementation at [github.com/topliceanu/graphql-go-example](https://github.com/topliceanu/graphql-go-example)
